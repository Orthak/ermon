==================================

ERMON is a simple application to perform healthy habits 
while working with computers.
 
Once started, the application notifies the user 
from time to time to do basic activities called "events" 
- like blink repeatedly, stretch shoulders or walk a little- 
in order to reduce and prevent symptoms related with 
the prolonged use of computers: dry eyes, back and wrists pain, 
early fatigue, and so on.

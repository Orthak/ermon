CONTRIBUTIONS
=============
Ermon is open to any kind of contributions, from fixes to new features, including requests.

To do so, open an issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/amcajal/ermon/issues) of the project. Remember to be polite (otherwise, it will be deleted),
and provide enough information. More details the better!

Given the scope of the project, certain degree of
freedom is allowed when summiting issues or starting pull requests. However, **coherency** is key to keep the project clean
and easy to manage. To do so, a set of general rules or recommendations are given below, that can be summarized in
"keep to try the project with the same appearance". 
To aid the user in this goal, *project/doc/templates* contains a bunch of template files ready to be used for
starting new source code files, create new scripts, etc. And of course, the current project files can be used as example.

***And in case of doubt, do not hesitate to ask!***

TOOLS
=====

Below are listed all tools used to develop Ermon. All of them are __free__ 
(in the economic meaning of the word), and __Open Source__ when possible.
Of course, this list is not conclusive, and the user may find several others that serves the same purposes.

Consider "tools" as the "computer elements" involved in the creation of the application, instead
of the more professional [definition of tool provided in The Jargon File](http://catb.org/jargon/html/T/tool.html).

**Hardware and OS**
- Generic Laptop computer (4GB RAM, Intel Centrino (circa 2009)) with Ubuntu 12.04
    -    _GNU binutils and other basic software already included in Ubuntu 12.04 OS is not listed here.
	  For example: text editors (gedit)_

    _Note_: The Generic Laptop decided to name itself "September". The explanation to this [is here](https://github.com/amcajal/gsvmind)

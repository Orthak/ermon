PHILOSOPHY
==========
Ermon has been developed with several principles, practices and patters in mind (the famous P.P.P), most of them complementary.

A readable (meaningfull names, meaningfull comments) well structured code (modularity, clear interfaces, high cohesion and low coupling)
is the ultimage goal. Special dedication has been put in the documentation of the code, generating a dedicated webpage (Github page) with it. @TODO

Finally, this very documentation of the Wiki, the [branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
at GitHub, issue tracker templates and others aspects of the project like
the directory hierachy aims to make this project easy: to understand, to use, to expand...

Users shall decide if it is achieved or not.

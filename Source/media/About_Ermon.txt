==================================

ERMON is a simple application to perform healthy habits 
while working with computers.
 
Once started, the application notifies the user 
from time to time to do basic activities called "events" 
- like blink repeatedly, stretch shoulders or walk a little- 
in order to reduce and prevent symptoms related with 
the prolonged use of computers: dry eyes, back and wrists pain, 
early fatigue, and so on.

Ermon main features are:

- EASY TO USE: Aimed to all audiences -typical users, gamers, 
programmers - anyone who works or uses a computer. 
Easy as press play and let the application work.

- CUT TO THE CHASE: No initial set-up needed. The application has 
a default list of events available, 
based on a basic research about ergonomic science.

- MULTI-PLATFORM: Works in Windows, Linux and Mac.

- PORTABLE: No installation needed. 
Just click on the application, and run. 

- CUSTOMIZABLE: New events can be created, modified and saved. 
Basic tool configuration options can be set too.

And of course, completely FREE!

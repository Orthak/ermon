### Overview

**Ermon** (ERgonomic MONitor) is a simple application to perform healthy habits while working with computers. Once started, the application notifies the user from time to time to do basic activities called "events"- like blink repeatedly, stretch shoulders or walk a little- in order to reduce and prevent symptoms related with the prolonged use of computers: dry eyes, back and wrists pain, early fatigue, and so on.

Ermon main features are:

- **Easy to use**: Aimed to all audiences -typical users, gamers, programmers - anyone who works or uses a computer. Easy as press play and let the application work.
- **Cut to the chase**: No initial set-up needed. The application has a default list of events available, based on a basic research about ergonomic science.
- **Multi-platform**: Works in Windows, Linux and Mac.
- **Portable**: No installation needed. Just click on the application, and run. 
- **Customizable**: New events can be created, modified and saved. Basic tool configuration options can be set too.

And of course, completely FREE and OPEN SOURCE.

#### This project has been created trying to make it usefull. This project has been created in order to learn new things. But over all, this project has been created because it is fun. As Isaac Asimov said:

*The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka' but 'Thatâ€™s funny...'*
